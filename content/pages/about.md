Currently living in Kyoto, Japan and working as a remote Freelancer I get to combine the three things I enjoy the most. New tech, studying and traveling. Coding really connected the first two for me and lets me engage with new cool tech and actually understand what goes on under the hood. The constant learning curve with coding will never get boring and is a constant pursue to improve.

By working remotely I get to do my third love: traveling. Currently living in Japan I get to learn and experience the rich traditional culture and meet different people and approaches at coding meetups of which there are many. Feel free to reach out if you are in the area! And if even you're not text anytime.
